# Rapidly-Exploring-Random-Trees-with-Point-and-Line-Robot-
Implementing RRT planning algorithm in 2D with a point robot (x,y) and a line robot (x,y,theta)

RRT ran with uniform and Gaussian distribution.

point robot: rrt_planner_point_robot.py

line robot: rrt_planner_line_robot.py

UI code was given. I implemented the algorithm.


See report for more details on the how it looks and the result.
